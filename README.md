# Movies-ETL

## Purpose

To view the final analysis and code used to generate the database, click here: [Clean_Data](https://github.com/fadlnabbouh/movies-etl/blob/main/ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb), [Create_Database](https://github.com/fadlnabbouh/movies-etl/blob/main/ETL_create_database.ipynb). 

The purpose of this analysis was to create an automated pipeline using python functions that automatically takes in new data, transforms it, and loads the data into an existing database. I refactored previously written code to generate the more efficient functions included here and then used python code to generate a database in PostgreSQL.
